- Series of linked nodes where each node points to the next node in the list. The pointer is the link.
- Each node has a value and a pointer reference to the next node.
- Doubly linked lists have two pointers for each node, one to the next node and one to the previous node.
- Linked lists are LIFO "last in first out." Nodes are added to and deleted from the same end
- Searching for a node in a linked list requires iterating through the list until the node is found. Worst case, this is O(n)

## Linked List Methods

- `push(item)`
  - Add an item to the list
- `pop()`
  - Remove an item from the list
- `get(index)`
  - Return an element at a given index, without removing it from the list
- `delete(index)`
  - Delete an element at a given index
- `isEmoty()`
  - Convenience method to check whether the list is empty
